    Individual, task specific needs of amputees are not often met by standard prosthetic devices. There is a need for inexpensive, easily accessible, and customizable prosthetic solutions to help people accomplish their unique goals and aspirations.

## Make things easier
With the first part of this project we worked with Agrability and our client in Colorado named Juan Negrete, who is missing his left forearm. We designed specific prosthetics for tasks that his current prosthetic were unable to accomplish. Our goal was to enable Juan to more easily drive a tractor, pick up a wheelbarrow or bucket, and make Christmas wreaths. Our designs are done with 3D solid-modeling software such as Solidworks, in addition to sending prototypes to Juan, we will send designs to his occupational therapist so she can 3D-print replacements locally.

## Need for reprinting
 Due to wear and tear caused by manual farming jobs it was important provide Juan with the ability to reprint as needed. Our last goal was for Juan to test our prototypes, this has given us more insight to what can be improved in our prototypes.

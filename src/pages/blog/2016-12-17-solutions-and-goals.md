    Individual, task specific needs of amputees are not often met by standard prosthetic devices. There is a need for inexpensive, easily accessible, and customizable prosthetic solutions to help people accomplish their unique goals and aspirations.

## Solutions

The Claw
-The Claw was designed as a solution for Juan to carry buckets, build Christmas wreaths, and have a little more dexterity.
The Wrist Connector
-A device designed to enable Juan to interface with equipment controls, such as a large tractor, while still wearing his main prosthetic device.
The Guitar Pick Holder
-The Pick Holder was designed to help a colleague named Evan Bonazzola who has symbrachydactyly. This simple Solidworks and 3D printed design enables Evan to play the guitar.

## Goals

In addition to providing Juan with a final product, our goal is to create a website/platform that allows people with design or engineering expertise to connect with and produce affordable prosthetic devices for those who face limitations with their current device. 3D printing and open source designs will be used to increase the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of the custom solutions. This type of servant engineering is great for understanding human centered design techniques.

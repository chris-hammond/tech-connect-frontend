    Individual, task specific needs of amputees are not often met by standard prosthetic devices. There is a need for inexpensive, easily accessible, and customizable prosthetic solutions to help people accomplish their unique goals and aspirations.

## Helping Peers
With our second proof of concept we are helping our peer Evan Bonazzola. Evan has a condition, symbrachydactyly, where the fingers and hand do not fully develop. This becomes a problem when trying to perform everyday tasks and hobbies. Evan gave us the task to help him make a guitar pick he could use, because he has always wanted to learn to play. We designed a solution to help hold a thin pick more comfortably and easily.

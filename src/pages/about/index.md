  Tech Connect is a webservice meant for connecting developers and the minds
  behind projects, run by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF). MAF is all about
  making connections -- and technology plays a key roles. We want to introduce
  isolated people to Jesus Christ through a network of technology and
  discipleship strategies. Technology constantly changes, so MAF Tech Resources
  is always adapting to create opportunities to connect people to Jesus. We use
  technology in a variety of ways in order to bring God's Word into the most
  remote parts of the world; providing connectivity through email and VPN
  services, and VSAT and HF/VHF radio installations; digital solutions for
  missions like mobile apps with the Bible and Christian materials; and business
  services that support our flight programs around the world. Tech Connect is a

  It's the best way to connect with people who can truly help you. There's a
  class of people called 'early adopters', but Tech Connect sponsors are so much
  earlier than that!

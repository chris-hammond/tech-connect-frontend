  Tech Connect is looking for people with a faith in Jesus Christ and the desire
  to share their time and talents to further the Kingdom of God.

aboutTechConnect: >-
  Tech Connect is a webservice meant for connecting developers and the minds
  behind projects, run by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF). MAF wants to
  ensure that no technically skilled person feels their skills have no impact
  and that no mission minded person feels unequipped to accomplish their goals
  of furthering the Kingdom of God. MAF believes that both of these goals can
  be met through Tech Connect!

aboutMAF: >-
  MAF is all about making connections -- and technology plays a key roles. We 
  want to introduce isolated people to Jesus Christ through a network of technology 
  anddiscipleship strategies. Technology constantly changes, so MAF Tech Resources
  is always adapting to create opportunities to connect people to Jesus. We use
  technology in a variety of ways in order to bring God's Word into the most
  remote parts of the world; providing connectivity through email and VPN
  services, and VSAT and HF/VHF radio installations; digital solutions for
  missions like mobile apps with the Bible and Christian materials; and business
  services that support our flight programs around the world.

  "It's the best way to connect with people who can truly help you. There's a
  class of people called 'early adopters', but Tech Connect sponsors are so much
  earlier than that!"
